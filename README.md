# Hardhat Project - Testing Smart Contract deployment

Just Messing around, with learning how to deploy smart contracts on eth  (Sepolia test net)
Smart Contract --> https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x43a41E43fc4271DF50000E8Ffe5C183C8a6ca663

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
